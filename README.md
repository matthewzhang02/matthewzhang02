## Student at Baylor University: Data Science Major

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! My name is Matthew Zhang and I am currently studying Data Science at Baylor University and I am a Junior. I have had a long-standing fascination with the science of data and how to analyse data to produce a tangible result. I am especially interested in how to apply data driven solutions to Basketball and the Aviation industry, two of my interests growing up. This is a portfolio of the projects I have completed both inside and outside of the classroom.
